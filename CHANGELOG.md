## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Root `Justfile` command surface with `setup`, `fast`, `check`, `verify`,
  `security`, `audit`, and `release` lanes for one-command setup and validation.
- `ops/ci/pr-ci.sh`, the pull-request CI entrypoint the self-hosted
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runner calls, so local runs and CI execute identical
  commands.
- Agent-readable documentation: `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`,
  `docs/boundaries.md`, `docs/testing.md`, `docs/release.md`, and
  `docs/exceptions.md`.
- `agent/audit-policy.toml` with `[scan]` exclusions for transient build trees,
  and `agent/boundaries.toml` plus `agent/proof-lanes.toml` scoped to this
  member.

### Changed

- Re-scoped `agent/generated-zones.toml` to the only generated tree that exists
  here (`target/`), and removed the dangling `dist/`, `.fusion/`, and
  `package-lock.json` zone entries.
- Re-scoped `agent/owner-map.json` and `agent/test-map.json` to assign an owner
  and a proof route to every top-level path that exists in this repo.
- Rewrote the legacy "internal GitLab" remote/origin/MR references in
  `ops/ci/node-tools.sh`, `ops/ci/post-main-shadow.sh`, `ops/AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/ci-local.md`, and the audit-masking issue template to the Jeryu remote
  `ssh://git@127.0.0.1:2224/root/*`.

## [1.6.10] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Initial split-family extraction of the jankurai release and mirroring tooling.
