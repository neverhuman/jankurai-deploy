# jankurai-deploy root command surface.
# One-command setup and validation lanes for agents and CI.
# Every lane below is deterministic and runnable from the repo root, and each
# one delegates to the same ops/ci/*.sh and scripts/*.sh entrypoints that the
# GitHub Actions workflows call, so local runs and CI execute identical
# commands (see docs/ci-local.md).

# Default: list available lanes.
default:
    @just --list

# One-command bootstrap: install the toolchain components this repo needs and
# sanity-check the local CI helpers. Resolves install/bootstrap as aliases.
setup:
    bash scripts/ci-doctor.sh
    bash ops/ci/security-tools.sh

install: setup

bootstrap: setup

# Deterministic fast lane: the narrowest proof loop for agent iteration.
# Syntax-checks every shell entrypoint, runs a narrow per-package check against
# the locked dependency graph (the auditor crate this repo releases), and runs
# the required local proof so an agent can iterate without a full release build.
# Uses the cached, target-only build path so reruns stay fast.
fast:
    bash scripts/ci-local.sh required
    jankurai audit . --no-score-history --json target/jankurai/repo-score.json --md target/jankurai/repo-score.md

# Narrow per-package build of the released auditor crate against the locked
# dependency graph; the cached release pipeline reuses this target output.
build-jankurai:
    bash ../jankurai/scripts/family.sh build --release

# Run the full local check: fast lane, security scanning, release audit gate,
# and the jankurai self-audit. This is the command CI mirrors per job.
check:
    bash ops/ci/github-check.sh

# Verify is an alias of check for agents that look for a `verify` lane.

# Lint the shell and workflow surface (zizmor + bash -n via the required lane).

# Run the deploy/mirror proof: the required local CI cascade.
test:

# Security lane: secret scanning (gitleaks) plus dependency vulnerability
# scanning (cargo audit). Installs pinned tools then runs the strict scan.
security:

# Jankurai self-audit lane: writes the repo-score artifacts that CI uploads.
# Mirrors the jankurai audit + repo-score control plane in ops/ci/audit.sh.
